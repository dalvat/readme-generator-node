# Readme Generator (node.js)

## Description

This is a README file generator to quickly and easily create a high-quality README file for your project. Infact, this file was created using the app!

Writing README files from scratch everytime is tedious and time consuming. That's where this commandline app comes in to help streamline the process and simply add all of the information you need!

When you choose the appropriate license for your project, a badge is displayed at the top of the README file and in the license section, with links to read more about the license type. This way it is clear to anyone viewing your project if there are any restrictions they need to be aware of!
